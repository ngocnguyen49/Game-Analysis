## Project 3: A/B Testing for Game Version Evaluation

**Purpose:**  
The A/B Testing project aims to compare two versions of a game to determine which performs better based on user engagement and retention metrics. The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, detect anomalies, and identify key behavioral patterns. Using Python for statistical analysis, the project then applies hypothesis testing to draw data-driven conclusions and support product decisions for improving game design and user experience.
